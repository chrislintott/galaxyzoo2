GZ2 data release paper
Summary of changes from first round of feedback
Mar 14, 2013

Global themes:

- I have done a lot of work
- Looks pretty good so far
- Most people are OK with a data release paper only
- Some votes for including more descriptions of past GZ2 science
- Tighten up vocabulary and descriptions
- Section 5 can be trimmed down somewhat
- Check on the actual data and debiasing w/Brooke
- no feedback from Chris yet.
- improved the T-type mapping using a better linear combo. No input at all from the arms winding categories - interesting!

coadded or co-added

answers/responses


Kevin Schawinski

- missing Kevin's even-numbered pages, but he no longer has the original hardcopy
- supports not including the matched SDSS metadata as a table

Jordan Raddick

- should we mention CSA/Zooniverse anywhere?
- does the color-stretch in Section 2.2 apply to coadd1, coadd2, or both?
- questions on Section 3.2 - ask SB. Especially good point on consistency: why does agreeing with the majority imply that users are correct?
- everyone's doing a good job of catching my demonstrative pronouns
- how to justify Equation 5?
- add table with minimum thresholds and vote counts per task
- online or Appendix version of Fig. 4, with baseline morphology ratios for all response pairs?
- raises the issue of 50% thresholds
- What should users do about the rare objects with high variance in Stripe 82?
- How do differences in coadded data affect use by potential users?
- Suggestion: add section 4.4 with example cases on using data

Lucy Fortson

- disagree on date formatting; ISO-8601 is the gold standard.
- why was coadd1 removed from the site at 18 votes? Preference for coadd2 with better noise characteristics?
- what do the dashed lines mean in Figure 2 (consistency)?
- check calculations in Eqns. 4-15; Eqns 13-15 look inverted.

Mike Williams

- check the figures on threshold and clean criterion (agreed)

Karen Masters

- no science is OK by her; support writing a short science paper ASAP
- be careful when referring to NA10 or EFIGI as "truth"
- early-type = E/S0/S0a, late-type = Sab and later?
- add science results from GZ2: Masters, Hoyle, Simmons, Kaviraj. Others?
- Absolute magnitude limit: -20.94 (KLM) vs -20.89 (KWW)?
- bigger section comparing S82 single-depth and coadd
- will make a p_bar plot for Hoyle comparisons to EFIGI
- f_x -> v_X; vote fractions vs. fraction of galaxies with characteristic?
